# Frederico's Portfolio - React + Vite

This is my personal portfolio built using React and Vite to showcase my web development skills, projects, and experience. The project leverages **React** for building the user interface and **Vite** as a fast build tool and development server. I’ve used **Tailwind CSS** for styling with a utility-first approach, while animations are powered by **Framer Motion**. For navigation, I’ve integrated **React Router**, and smooth scrolling is handled by **React Scroll**. To add some dynamic effects, I’ve included a typing animation using **React Typing Effect**. The portfolio is deployed on **GitHub Pages**, and you can view it live at [https://fredh2o.github.io/portfolio](https://fredh2o.github.io/portfolio).

Technologies used include **React**, **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Framer Motion**, **React Router**, **React Scroll**, and **React Typing Effect**. For dependencies, I’ve used **Axios** for API requests, **Heroicons** for icons, and **@fontsource/poppins** for typography. Development tools include **ESLint**, **PostCSS**, **Autoprefixer**, and **gh-pages** for deployment. This project is fully responsive, optimized, and demonstrates my skills in modern web development.

Feel free to explore the code and connect with me for any further questions or collaborations.
